# LassoPath

### **Intro**

Before the creation of this project, I already had a prototype. 

This is created via `PkgTemplate.jl`, this is the package template creator for this project. 

The workflow of the project will be boosted by `Revise.jl`.

### **LassoPath**

Change the value of the L1 regularization until the solution reaches zero, then the values for predictors, or the weights of the regression parameters are identified. 

The most important parameters are the ones that still stays as the penalization gets bigger.
