# LassoPath

### **Intro**

Before the creation of this project, I already had a prototype. 

This is created via `PkgTemplate.jl`, this is the package template creator for this project. 

The workflow of the project will be boosted by `Revise.jl`.

### **LassoPath**

Change the value of the L1 regularization until the solution reaches zero, then the values for predictors, or the weights of the regression parameters are identified. 

The most important parameters are the ones that still stays as the penalization gets bigger. 

**Approach**: 
1. Phrase the lasso problem as a quadratic programming problem
2. solve it with different parameters of lambda, with a warm start on the solver. 

**Problem**:
* This is going to be slow because the solver is single threaded, and not an interior points based method, it's a much general one, it's an ADMM based conic programming solver. An QP might be more better for Lasso type of problem. 

* It's kinda redundant because it modifies the model for the solver each time.

### **Usage Examples**

The crime dataset is analyzed in the file [here](./usage_examples/crime_data/data_analyze.jl), where we created the lasso path plot: 

![](./usage_examples/crime_data/plot.png)

and the top predictors for crime rate over a county are identified to be: 

```
 "PctKids2Par"       "-"
 "PctIlleg"          "+"
 "racePctWhite"      "-"
 "HousVacant"        "+"
 "MalePctDivorce"    "+"
 "PctPersDenseHous"  "+"
 "pctUrban"          "+"
 "PctHousOccup"      "-"
 "PctVacantBoarded"  "+"
 "racepctblack"      "+"
```

And these predictor's description is: 


```
-- PctKids2Par: percentage of kids in family housing with two parents (numeric - decimal)
-- PctIlleg: percentage of kids born to never married (numeric - decimal)
-- racePctWhite: percentage of population that is caucasian (numeric - decimal)
-- HousVacant: number of vacant households (numeric - decimal)
-- MalePctDivorce: percentage of males who are divorced (numeric - decimal)
-- PctPersDenseHous: percent of persons in dense housing (more than 1 person per room) (numeric - decimal)
-- pctUrban: percentage of people living in areas classified as urban (numeric - decimal)
-- PctHousOccup: percent of housing occupied (numeric - decimal)
-- PctVacantBoarded: percent of vacant housing that is boarded up (numeric - decimal)
-- racepctblack: percentage of population that is african american (numeric - decimal)
```

The usage for the package is simple, and it's like: 

```julia
# Analyze the data using Lasso Path pacakge I wrote. 
cd("C:\\Users\\victo\\source\\repos\\Silly_Julia_stuff\\Julia Packages\\LassoPath\\usage_examples\\crime_data")
using DelimitedFiles, CSV, DataFrames
using LassoPath

Df = CSV.read("process_data.csv", DataFrame)
Df = Df[!, Not([:state, :fold])]

# Extrac Numerics, predictors, predictants. 
A, b = Matrix(Df[:, Not(end)]), Df[:, end]

PrintTitle("The Data is ready, we are ready for analyais now")

lassoIntance = LassoSCOP(A, b)

GetLassoPath(lassoIntance)

VisualizeLassoPath(lassoIntance)

predictorIndices, Î», ws = CaptureImportantWeights(lassoIntance, 10, 1e-2)

PrintTitle("Important Predictors are")

predictors = names(Df[:, Not(end)])[predictorIndices]
impacts = map(ws) do x
    if x >= 0 
        return "+"
    else 
        return "-"
    end
end

display([reshape(predictors, :) reshape(impacts, :)])


```

Nice and easy code.
